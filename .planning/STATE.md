# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-18)

**Core value:** Users can ask questions in natural language and get accurate, cited answers from their organization's knowledge base — with strict access control ensuring each team only sees what they're authorized to access.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Migration Stabilization

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Migration Stabilization)
Plan: 1 of 4 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-18 — Plan 01-01 complete (Playwright E2E infrastructure + dataset CRUD tests)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 25%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 5 min
- Total execution time: 0.08 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 1 | 5 min | 5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5 min)
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01 P01 | 5min | 2 tasks | 8 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-phase]: CASL (@casl/ability 6.8.0 + @casl/react 4.x) chosen for ABAC — in-process, no external service, PostgreSQL JSONB rule storage, Valkey cache per session
- [Pre-phase]: ABAC enforcement must be at service layer (OpenSearch query filter), not only Express middleware — middleware cannot protect retrieval paths
- [Pre-phase]: Pool model for OpenSearch multi-tenancy (single shared index with mandatory tenant_id filter) — recommended over per-tenant index; silo model reserved for HIPAA-strict tenants
- [Pre-phase]: GraphRAG and Deep Research are migration tasks — full Python implementations already exist in advance-rag/; no new Python packages needed
- [Pre-phase]: SYSTEM_TENANT_ID consolidation must happen in Phase 2 before any ABAC work — 5 files currently reading directly from process.env
- [Phase 1, Plan 01]: Local account login for E2E auth fixture -- simpler than Azure AD, works with default dev credentials
- [Phase 1, Plan 01]: Sequential single-worker Playwright execution to avoid DB race conditions

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 2 prerequisite (Pitfall 1):** SYSTEM_TENANT_ID hardcoded in 5 files — must consolidate OpenSearch client construction into shared service before multi-tenant feature work begins. Tracked as Plan 02-01.
- **Phase 5 risk (Pitfall 5):** Deep Research token cost spiral — existing maxDepth:3 guard is insufficient; hard caps on LLM calls (10-15) and token budget (50K default) are mandatory before shipping.
- **Phase 4 research flag:** GraphRAG indexing cost — LazyGraphRAG vs full GraphRAG tradeoff needs validation during Phase 4 planning before committing to default mode.
- **Phase 5 research flag:** Token budget sizing and semantic similarity caching strategy for Deep Research needs validation during Phase 5 planning.
