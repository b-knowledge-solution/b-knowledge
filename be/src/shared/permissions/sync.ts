/**
 * @fileoverview Boot-time permission registry sync.
 *
 * Reconciles the in-code permission registry (`getAllPermissions()`) with
 * the `permissions` catalog table:
 *
 *   1. UPSERT every registered permission so new keys are inserted and
 *      payload-only changes (label, subject, etc.) are merged.
 *   2. DELETE catalog rows whose key is no longer in the registry — these
 *      are stale entries from a removed feature. Removal is automatic but
 *      LOUDLY logged so deploy reviewers see it.
 *
 * The function is idempotent: a warm restart with no registry change is a
 * `{ inserted: 0, updated: 0, removed: 0 }` no-op.
 *
 * Failure mode: this service MUST NOT crash the server. The legacy `rbac.ts`
 * shim is still the active auth path during Phase 1, so a sync failure is
 * logged + rethrown to the caller, which wraps it in try/catch and continues
 * startup. See `app/index.ts` for the call site.
